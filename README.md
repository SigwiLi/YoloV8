# YoloV8 by SigwiLi

This repository contains a customized implementation of the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection model, tailored by SigwiLi. YOLOv8 is known for its real-time object detection capabilities and high accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Efficient detection suitable for real-time applications.
- **Custom Enhancements**: Modifications and improvements over the standard YOLOv8 implementation.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for various deployment scenarios, including edge devices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SigwiLi/YoloV8.git
   cd YoloV8
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model on your dataset:

```bash
python train.py --data /path/to/your/data.yaml --epochs 50 --batch-size 16
```

### Inference

To run inference on an image:

```bash
python detect.py --weights weights/best.pt --source /path/to/image.jpg
```

## Customization

This implementation includes the following customizations:

- [List specific customizations here, e.g., modified architecture, additional layers, custom loss functions, etc.]

## Results
